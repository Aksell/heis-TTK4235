# UML diagrams

These are the UML dagrams for the elevator project.
They are made using [lucid chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/uml_diagram_tool), 
and are to be updated as the project developes. 
To get the latest version you can check the [lucid chart folder](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/c6aceeb8-6069-4023-a487-88c48273557c)

## sequence diagram scenario
* the elevator is empty, and standing still in the second floor with the door open
* one person request the elevator in the first floor, going up
* the elevator arrives, she orders transport to the third floor

for simplicity no other people can interact with the elevator during the sequence.
